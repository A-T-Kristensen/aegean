Aegean
=========
Configuration framework for the T-Crest platform (Aegean)

Aegean is a collection of Python scripts that generates an instance of the time-predictable multicore platform. The configuration of a given platform is described in XML files. Some example XML files containing platform configurations are placed in the config/ directory.

The default platform is generated with a simple
